    <h1>About ReWear</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p><strong>ReWear</strong> is more than just a platform - it's a small step toward a greener and kinder world.</p>

    <p>We believe that fashion doesn't have to be wasteful. Every year, millions of clothes are thrown away while others go without. ReWear was created to change that.</p>

    <p>Our goal is simple: make it easy for people to <strong>exchange clothes they no longer wear</strong> and give them a second life. Whether you're swapping directly with someone or using your points to grab a new outfit, you're helping reduce waste and support sustainable fashion.</p>

    <p>We're a community that believes in sharing, in caring for the planet, and in making small changes that matter. Everyone deserves to feel good — and do good — without spending big.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <em>"The world doesn't need a few people doing sustainability perfectly. It needs millions doing it imperfectly."</em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Thank you for being a part of this journey. Let's ReWear, not re-buy.</p>
